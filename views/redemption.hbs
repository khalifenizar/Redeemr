                            <strong>Take Stock in Children</strong> provides a unique opportunity for deserving low-income youth/students, many from minority families, to escape the cycle of poverty through education. They offer their students college scholarships, caring volunteer mentors and hope for a better life. Their comprehensive services start in middle school, continue through high school and include their transition into college.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our program is based on the principal that given extensive support, motivation and accountability, children will work hard to ensure that they graduate from high school and attain a college degree. We fund our college scholarships and student services through a unique public-private fund raising model, and our mentors generously volunteer their mentoring services to our children.</p>
                        <p>

Take Stock in Childrenâ€™s multi-year commitment to at-risk children throughout our state is also an investment in the communities in which our students live. We know that the education of a child is an investment in their future and the assured way of breaking the cycle of poverty. Our goal is to continue to reduce the number of high school drop-outs and to increase the number of students who finish college and enter the workforce successfully.
